## Getting Started

### What You Need
- <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> (v18.18.0 or newer)
- <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> (v11.18 or newer)

### How to Get It Running
1. **Clone the Project:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RGBlife/news-api.git
   cd news-api
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up your Environments:**

You will need to add the following environment variables to connect to the databases if you wish to clone the project and run it locally.

You‚Äôll need to create two .env files: one for development (.env.development) and one for testing (.env.test). These should contain the variables needed for database connections.

Example files:
### .env.development file
```
PGDATABASE=nc_news
```
### .env.test file
```
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```
### .env.production file (if you are hosting the api)
``` 
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
PORT=your_chosen_port
```
4. **Populate the Database:**
```
npm run seed
```
5. **Run the Tests:**
To ensure all the tests succeed, you'll need to install devDependencies, jest (extensions to jest), pg-format by running the following command.
```
npm install jest-extended -D
npm install jest-sorted -D
npm install jest -D
npm install pg-format -D
npm test
```
